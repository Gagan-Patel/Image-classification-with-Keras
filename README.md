# Image-classification-with-Tensorflow
## Unsupervised learning
### Description

In this project,python application is built that train an image classifier on a dataset, then predict new images using the trained model. The project was devided to two parts. Dataset contains 102 flower categories, 

Part 1 - Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning
In this first part of the project, implemened an image classifier with Tensorflow.This project is used to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.

Part 2 - Building the command line application
Build a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line to train an image classifier and to predict new images using the trained model.


The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset

Train the image classifier on your dataset

Use the trained classifier to predict image content

Sanity Check

The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook then converted in a dash application using command line.
